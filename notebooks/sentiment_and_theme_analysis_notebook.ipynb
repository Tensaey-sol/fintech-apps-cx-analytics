    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook conducts a comprehensive sentiment and thematic analysis of user reviews for mobile banking apps from three Ethiopian banks: Bank of Abyssinia, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, and Dashen Bank. The goal is to quantify user sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and identify recurring themes to uncover satisfaction drivers and pain points. This analysis supports Task 2 of the project, which involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using the VADER sentiment analyzer to compute sentiment scores and labels for reviews, aggregated by bank and rating.\n",
    "- **Thematic Analysis**: Extracting keywords via TF-IDF and grouping them into 3–5 themes per bank (e.g., Account Access, Performance, User Experience) using a rule-based mapping approach.\n",
    "- **Pipeline**: Preprocessing text (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization) with spaCy, saving results to CSV, and ensuring modularity.\n",
    "- **KPIs**: Achieving sentiment scores for 90%+ reviews, identifying 3+ themes per bank, and maintaining a modular codebase.\n",

    "3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `analyzer.predict` to compute sentiment labels and scores for each review. Results are split into `sentiment_label` (e.g., “positive”) and `sentiment_score` (a float between -1 and 1).\n",
    "4. **Keyword Extraction**: Applies `extract_keywords` to `cleaned_review` using TF-IDF, extracting the top 5 keywords or n-grams per review, stored in a `keywords` column.\n",
    "5. **Theme Mapping**: Maps keywords to themes using `map_keywords_to_themes` and `theme_map`, storing results in a `themes` column. Reviews without mapped themes are labeled “Other.”\n",
    "6. **Save Output**: Saves the enriched DataFrame (with `sentiment_label`, `sentiment_score`, `keywords`, `themes`) to a new CSV (e.g., `bank_of_abyssinia_reviews_with_sentiment_themes.csv`).\n",
    "7. **Aggregate Sentiment**: Computes mean sentiment scores by rating for the bank using `aggregate_sentiment_by_rating`, storing results in `summary_records` for later analysis.\n"

    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Achieved 100% for coverage all (>400 reviews), with scores aggregated by bank and by rating.\n",
    "- **Thematic Analysis**: Identified at least two themes per bank (Account Access, Performance, User Experience, Support, Transactions, Feature Request), with keywords like “login” or “slow” mapped to themes.\n",
    "- **Pipeline**: Used a modular pipeline with preprocessing, `pandas`, and spaCy, saving results to CSV files.\n",
    "- **Themes**: Extracted 3–5 themes per bank via rule-based keyword clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results highlight key user concerns (e.g., performance issues in 1-star reviews) and satisfaction drivers (e.g., positive sentiment in 5-star reviews for Dashen Bank). Future improvements could include using a transformer-based model like DistilBERT for sentiment analysis or topic modeling (e.g., LDA) more dynamic for theme discovery."
